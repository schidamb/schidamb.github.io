Hello! I'm Subbu, a researcher specializing in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am currently advance research at Amazon Science within the Human in the Loop organization's Ground Truth+ team, under the guidance of [Alex Williams](https://acwio.github.io/) and [Erran Li](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~lierranli/). My current work focuses on Conversational AI, Model Steerability, and Human-AI Agent interactions. I leverage my background in HCI to enhance data annotation processes for machine learning model development.

I earned my Ph.D. from Purdue University's [C Design Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/), where I specialized in designing, developing, and evaluating novel 3D interfaces and interaction techniques to progress Extended Reality (XR) applications. I am deeply passionate about the potential of AI to transform human interactions with technology and its implications for our future. My aim is to integrate my expertise in HCI with my current research in AI to drive innovation and enrich everyday life. 
My research has been published at premier venues for HCI research, including ACM [CHI](https://chi2022.acm.org/), [CSCW](https://cscw.acm.org/2022/), [UIST](https://uist.acm.org/uist2022/), [Ubicomp](https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2021/), [DIS](https://dis.acm.org/2022/), and [ISMAR](https://www.ismar.net/). 

I am actively seeking opportunities beyond my Postdoc. If my work resonates with you, please don't hesitate to contact me at subbu10123 [at] gmail.com. Thank you!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
